# Claude Code Guide for This Project

## 🧠 Developer Preferences

I am a beginner learning to code. Please:
- Go slow and explain things step-by-step.
- Assume I don't know advanced terms or shortcuts.
- Give examples whenever possible.
- Pause after major steps and ask if I'm ready to continue.
- Avoid assuming I understand any of the code unless I confirm it.
